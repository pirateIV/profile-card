# Profile Card + Multi-Page Site â€” HNG Task Stage 1

A fully responsive and accessible **Profile Card** built with semantic HTML5, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
This submission extends my Stage 0 Profile Card project by adding two new pages - Contact Us (with validation) and About Me (reflective page).
This project serves as my submission for **HNG Internship Stage 0**, demonstrating understanding of core front-end principles, accessibility, semantic markup, responsive design, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## Features, Highlights & Things I Implemented

### Upgrades from Stage 0

-  New Pages(About me & Contact page)

-  Semantic HTML across all pages (`<main>, <header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>`).

-  Consistent theming with system color preference and manual switch.

-  Responsive grid and flex layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

-  Fully functional form with JavaScript validation.

-  Success message after valid submission (hides form after submit).

### Other implementations done in Stage 0

-  **Semantic HTML Structure**
   Built with clear, meaningful HTML elements such as `<article>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<figure>`, and `<time>` for accessibility and better SEO.

-  **Responsive Grid Layout**
   Scales seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using CSS Grid and Flexbox with fluid units and breakpoints.

-  **Dynamic Time Display**
   Displays the current time in milliseconds, updating automatically every second using `Date.now()` â€” helpful for demonstrating real-time JavaScript functionality.

-  **Accessible Design**
   All interactive elements have proper `aria-label`s and logical tab order, ensuring full keyboard navigation support.

-  **Theme Adaptability**
   Integrates with the systemâ€™s preferred color scheme via `prefers-color-scheme`, with an additional **manual toggle button** for dark and light mode switching.
